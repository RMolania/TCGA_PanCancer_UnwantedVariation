\usage{
computeCorr(data, is.log, type, cor.method, n.cores)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{S4 data object}

\item{is.log}{logical: Checks if the S4 data has log values. It 'False', it converts data to log scale.}

\item{type}{character: Variation variable to perform correlation with. type included are 'librarysize', 'purity_HTseq_counts', 'purity_HTseq_FPKM' and 'purity_HTseq_FPKM.UQ'.}

\item{cor.method}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient is to be used for the test. One of "pearson", "kendall", or "spearman", can be abbreviated. Default is spearman.}

\item{n.cores}{The number of cores to use, i.e. at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously. Must be at least one, and parallelization requires at least two cores.}
}
\value{
A S3 data frame. The output contains the correlation test output containing pvalue, adj p-value and
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Along with the data frame output the function also returns a histogram
for Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for easy analysis of the test results.
}
\description{
This function is a part of the data analysis functionality of \code{tcgaCleaneR}.
It helps to run correlation analysis between gene expression level and unwanted variation effect because of Library
Size or Purity. This function can help to quantify the association between an individual geneâ€™s expression level
and library size or tumor purity for a given Cancer type.
